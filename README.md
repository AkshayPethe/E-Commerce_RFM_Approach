## Introduction

This is a data analysis project that focuses on customer segmentation in an E-Commerce context. The primary objective of this project is to cluster customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and purchasing patterns. The segmentation is achieved through a combination of K-means clustering and Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) analysis.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial process in E-Commerce as it helps businesses identify and target different customer groups with personalized marketing strategies. In this project, we analyze customer transaction data to create customer segments based on their buying behavior, spending patterns, and the recency of their last purchase.

## Data

The data used for this project is anonymized customer transaction data, including customer IDs, transaction dates, and purchase amounts. The dataset is provided in CSV format and is included in the repository.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, and converting data types.

2. **RFM Analysis**: Computing Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer based on their transaction history.

3. **Clustering Techniques**: Applying K-means,DBSCAN,Agglomerative clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their RFM values.

4. **Clustering Evaluation**: Evaluating the different algorithm on the basis of Silhoutee Score,Davies-Bouldin Index and with
   different Visualization of Clusters.

## Results

The analysis and clustering results are visualized and summarized to provide insights into different customer segments. The final output includes the identified customer clusters and their corresponding characteristics on the basis of evaluation of different Clustering Algorithm.
